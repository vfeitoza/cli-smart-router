# Smart Model Router

`smart-model-router` is a native CLIProxyAPI plugin that registers a configurable virtual model and routes requests for that model to a real built-in provider/model.

The default virtual model is `router:auto`, but the name is configurable through `virtual_model`.

## Current Scope

This repository currently implements the router core plus the advanced features from the implementation plan:

- Native CLIProxyAPI C ABI entrypoint.
- `plugin.register` / `plugin.reconfigure` lifecycle.
- `model.register` virtual model registration.
- `model.route` routing for the configured virtual model only.
- Provider filtering through `AvailableProviders`.
- `/v1/models` catalog refresh through `host.http.do` when configured.
- External pricing fetch metadata through `host.http.do` when configured.
- Deterministic route cache with last-user-message hash keys, LRU eviction, and optional TTL.
- Session affinity for stable per-session routing.
- Local capability-aware deterministic scoring computed for every strategy, gating candidates by capabilities inferred from the prompt.
- Local-first `hybrid` strategy: skips the classifier when the local decision is confident, calls the classifier only when it is not.
- Optional LLM classifier routing through `host.model.execute` with isolated routing prompts.
- Cost/balanced/quality routing preference through `preference`.
- Optional same-request non-streaming fallback through plugin executor mode.
- `usage.handle` counters and persisted non-sensitive runtime state.
- Authenticated Management API status route.
- DDD-inspired package layout.

## Architecture

The code follows a small DDD-inspired structure:

```text
cmd/plugin/
  main.go                  # Native plugin ABI and method dispatch
internal/domain/
  config.go                # Config entities and normalization
  model.go                 # Candidate and decision types
  policy.go                # Capability-aware candidate scoring and selection
  capability.go            # Prompt -> capability tag inference
internal/application/
  router.go                # Routing use case
  registrar.go             # Virtual model registration use case
  usage.go                 # Usage counters
internal/infrastructure/
  cliproxy.go              # Minimal CLIProxyAPI JSON contracts used by V1
  rpc.go                   # RPC envelope helpers
  yaml_config.go           # config_yaml parsing
  state.go                 # In-memory config store
  runtime_state.go         # Non-sensitive runtime state, cache, catalog, pricing metadata
  prompt.go                # Shared last-user-message extraction
```

All code comments and configuration field descriptions are in English.

## Routing Behavior

The plugin only handles requests where `RequestedModel` matches `virtual_model`.

For all other models, it returns:

```json
{"Handled": false}
```

For the configured virtual model, it chooses a configured candidate whose provider is currently present in `AvailableProviders`. Configured `models` remain the authoritative source for provider, capability, cost, and quality metadata.

Decision order:

1. Existing session route, when session affinity is enabled.
2. Existing cache route, when cache is enabled and a valid entry exists.
3. Local capability-aware deterministic decision, computed for every strategy without any classifier call.
4. `hybrid`: use the local decision directly when it is confident (the prompt matched a capability the winning candidate declares); otherwise call the classifier. `llm`: always call the classifier. `capability`/`benchmark`: always use the local decision.
5. If the classifier is called and fails, use the local decision from step 3.

The local decision infers capability tags from the extracted last user message (for example, "resuma" implies `summarize`; "arquitetura" implies `architecture`/`planning`; "erro"/"bug" implies `coding`/`review`) and, when at least one candidate declares a matching capability, narrows selection to candidates that do. `preference` then ranks the remaining pool by cost/quality tier. See `docs/adr/0003-local-first-hybrid-routing.md` for details.

The classifier, when called, receives an isolated routing prompt with the configured model catalog and the extracted last user message. It must select a configured model; invalid classifier output falls back to the local deterministic decision.

Default provider-route response:

```json
{
  "Handled": true,
  "TargetKind": "provider",
  "Target": "codex",
  "TargetModel": "gpt-5.4-mini",
  "Reason": "classifier:short routing reason"
}
```

A `hybrid` request that skipped the classifier because the local decision was confident has a `Reason` prefixed with `local_confident`, for example `"local_confident deterministic_fallback strategy:hybrid capabilities:1/1 preference:balanced provider:codex cost:low"`.

When `executor_fallback.enabled: true` and the request is non-streaming, `model.route` returns `TargetKind: "self"`. The plugin executor then tries configured candidates in order with `host.model.execute` until one succeeds.

Complete field documentation is available in `docs/configuration.md`.

## Strategy And Preference

Supported strategies:

- `capability`: local capability-aware deterministic decision only. No classifier call.
- `benchmark`: currently behaves like `capability`; benchmark scoring is reserved for future measured data.
- `llm`: classifier first on every request, local deterministic decision as fallback on failure.
- `hybrid`: local-first. Uses the local decision directly when it is confident, skipping the classifier; otherwise behaves like `llm` for that request.

Supported preferences:

- `cost`: bias toward the cheapest acceptable model.
- `balanced`: default balance of cost and quality.
- `quality`: bias toward higher-quality models.

`preference` ranks the local capability-gated candidate pool, biases the classifier prompt (`llm`, or `hybrid` when not confident), and applies conservative post-classifier tiebreaks among equivalent-tier models.

## Local-First Hybrid Routing

Every strategy computes a local decision from configuration alone, with no host call: it infers capability tags from the extracted last user message (see `models[].capabilities` below), narrows candidates to those declaring a matching capability when at least one does, and ranks the result by `preference`.

The decision is "confident" only when the prompt matched a known capability signal and the winning candidate declares it. `strategy: hybrid` uses this to skip the classifier entirely for prompts the configuration already answers clearly, for example:

- "resuma isso" -> a low-cost/summarize-capable model, no classifier call.
- "corrija este erro Go..." -> a coding/review-capable model, no classifier call.
- "planeje a arquitetura de..." -> an architecture/planning-capable model, no classifier call.
- "faça isso melhor" -> ambiguous, no capability matched, classifier is called.

An ambiguous prompt, or a configuration where no candidate declares a matching capability, always falls through to the classifier under `hybrid` (or is used as-is under `capability`/`benchmark`, which never call a classifier). See `docs/adr/0003-local-first-hybrid-routing.md` for the full design rationale.

## Deterministic Cache

When `cache.enabled` is true, repeated identical prompts reuse the same route decision.

Cache behavior:

- Keyed by the configured virtual model and extracted last user message.
- Raw prompts are not stored; only a hash key is persisted.
- `cache.max_entries` bounds cache size.
- LRU eviction removes the least recently used entry when full.
- `cache.ttl` optionally expires old decisions.

The first request logs `source: selected`; repeated matching prompts should log `source: cache`. A `hybrid` request that used the local confident decision instead of the classifier still logs `source: selected`, with `reason` prefixed by `local_confident`.

## Management Status

The plugin registers this management route:

```text
GET /v0/management/plugins/smart-model-router/status
```

The route is exposed by CLIProxyAPI under `/v0/management/...` and requires the management key.

The response includes runtime state snapshots for catalog, pricing, counters, cache, sessions, and usage. It never stores prompts, request bodies, credentials, API keys, or response bodies.

## Live Verification Script

Use the helper script to verify the plugin against a running CLIProxyAPI instance:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
python3 scripts/check_smart_model_router.py --once
```

Required `.env` variables:

```env
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8317
API_KEY="management-api-key"
API_KEY_MODELS="models-api-key"
```

Authentication rules used by the script:

- `/v0/...` management endpoints use `API_KEY`.
- `/v1/...` model endpoints use `API_KEY_MODELS`.
- Both keys are sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Default basic verification checks:

- `GET /v0/management/plugins`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `GET /v0/management/plugins/smart-model-router/status`

Run the full verification, including a non-streaming chat completion through the virtual model and a post-chat status read:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_smart_model_router.py --once --all
```

Avoid running `--all` in a tight loop unless you intentionally want to generate repeated model requests.

Useful options:

- `--base-url <url>` overrides `BASE_URL` from `.env`.
- `--virtual-model <model>` overrides the default virtual model used by the check.
- `--verbose` prints raw JSON responses in addition to the console summary.

## Debug Route Logs

Enable non-sensitive JSONL route decision logs:

```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
  log_path: smart-model-router-decisions.jsonl
```

Each line includes the selected provider/model, strategy, preference, source, reason, and classifier trace when applicable. It does not log prompts, request bodies, credentials, API keys, or responses.
